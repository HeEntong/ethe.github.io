I am Entong He. I am a year-4 undergraduate student at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) pursuing a bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in computer science.

## (Research) Interests

- **Quantum Information:** quantum analogs of classical complexity classes (recently introduced to this field), non-local games, quantum sensing.
- **Network and Sensing:** sensor network localization, wireless sensing.

## News
