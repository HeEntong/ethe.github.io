I am Entong He. I am a year-4 undergraduate student at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) pursuing a bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in computer science.

## (Research) Interests

- **Quantum Information:** quantum analogs of classical complexity classes (recently introduced to this field), non-local games, quantum sensing.
- **Network and Sensing:** sensor network localization, wireless sensing.

## News

## CV of Failure 
Although my life has witnessed minor events of success, failure is inevitably the major theme of it. In the private discussion with my college mate Shunzhuang Huang (also a high school upperclassman, now a PhD candidate @ UChicago Booth), I realized that it is rather significant to memorize these failures so as not to be scammed by some insignificant success. Hope that this rapidly-growing document will be a kick on my backside. \
